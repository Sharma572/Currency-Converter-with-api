# Description

 In this project i use the URL of the Exchange rate API, which will be used to fetch information about the currents rates of currency .
 These values are retrieved from the API using JavaScript's built-in JSON parsing function (JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation).
 There are two select tag which helps to select the options of country and there is swap button for swaping the currency value and as well as country.
 
 # WHY this project was chosen ?
 
 Web API is a programming interface/application type that provides communication or interaction between software applications.
 Web API is often used to provide an interface for websites and client applications to have data access.
 Fetching the data from an api and rendering in a Dom is one of the important concept of modern Javascript.
